\chapter{Partition Functions and Ideal Gases}
\section{System Partition Functions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \marginnote{1/19:}Decomposing the partition function of a molecule into the product of separate sums as partitioned by degrees of freedom (e.g., translation, rotation, vibration, and electronic).
    \item The partition functions of \textbf{independent}, distinguishable/indistinguishable molecules.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We should not double count the same states.
        \item The $N!$ in $Q=q^N/N!$ is not important when calculating energy (because of the properties of the $\ln$ function), but it is very important when calculating quantities such as entropy.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Independent} (particles): A set of particles that do not interact with one another.
    \item Discusses bosons and fermions.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We can have a two fermions in the state $|1,1\rangle$ because it is a symmetric state.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Recall the Fermi level, the boundary between the filled and unfilled electronic states in a solid.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $T$ is small, this level is a hard boundary.
        \item If $T$ is large, electrons can easily be excited and the Fermi level is a soft boundary.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Does the 3D particle in a box derivation for the translation molecular partition function.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Note that since the de Broglie wavelength $\lambda_\text{DB}=\sqrt{h^2/2mk_BT}$, we may write
        \begin{equation*}
            q_x = \sum_{n_x}\e[-h^2/8mk_BTL_x^2]
            = \sum_{n_x}\e[-\lambda_\text{DB}^2n_x^2/4L_x^2]
        \end{equation*}
    \end{itemize}
    \item The number of states are occupied/have energy within $k_BT$ of the ground state.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $-\lambda_\text{DB}^2n_x^2/4L_x^2$ is on the order of 1, implying that $n_x$ is on the order of $2L/\lambda_\text{DB}$.
        \item It follows if $L$ is on a macroscopic scale (e.g., $L\approx\SI{1}{\meter}$) and $\lambda_\text{DB}$ is on a sub-angstrom scale that $n_x$ is on the order of $10^{10}$. When $n_x$ is at such a scale, $\e[-\lambda_\text{DB}^2n_x^2/4L_x^2]\approx 1/\e$.
        \item It follows that in a $\SI{1}{\cubic\meter}$ box, we will have about $10^{30}$ states, so we really are in a regime where the number of states is larger than the number of molecules.
    \end{itemize}
    \item More precisely, we want
    \begin{equation*}
        N \ll n_xn_yn_z = \left( \frac{8mk_BT}{h^2} \right)^{3/2}L_xL_yL_z
    \end{equation*}
    where the middle term approximates the number of states so that
    \begin{equation*}
        \frac{N}{V} \ll \left( \frac{8mk_BT}{h^2} \right)^{3/2}
    \end{equation*}
    \item Approximating the translational energy with an integral.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Concludes with the translational partition function.
        \item Since we can approach this problem from a classical perspective (as we did last Friday) or quantum mechanically (as we did today) to achieve the same result, this system again demonstrates the relation between quantum and classical mechanics.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}



\section{Molecular Partition Functions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \marginnote{1/21:}We approximate the total molecular energy as
    \begin{equation*}
        q = q_\text{elec}q_\text{trans}q_\text{vib}q_\text{rot}
    \end{equation*}
    \item The heat capacity in the very high temperature limit where translations, rotations, and vibrations are classical.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Translational: $\frac{3}{2}k_B$.
        \item Vibrational: Each degree of freedom ($3N-5$ for a linear molecule and $3N-6$ for a nonlinear molecule) contributes $k_B$.
        \item Rotational: Each degree of freedom ($2$ for a linear molecule and $3$ for a nonlinear molecule) contributes $\frac{1}{2}k_B$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item We can use the above to calculate the heat capacity of various molecules at very high temperatures (note, however, that at such temperatures, molecules would likely dissociate; we're simply theoretically considering the classical limit here).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \ce{Ne}: $\frac{3}{2}k_B$.
        \item \ce{H2O}: $\frac{3}{2}k_B+3\cdot k_B+3\cdot\frac{1}{2}k_B=6k_B$.
        \item \ce{O2}: $\frac{3}{2}+1\cdot k_B+2\cdot\frac{1}{2}k_B=\frac{7}{2}k_B$.
        \item \ce{CO2}: $\frac{3}{2}k_B+4\cdot k_B+2\cdot\frac{1}{2}k_B=\frac{13}{2}k_B$.
        \item \ce{CHCl3}: $\frac{3}{2}k_B+9\cdot k_B+3\cdot\frac{1}{2}k_B=12 k_B$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Electronic partition function.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Consider the bottom $D_e$ of the potential well of a diatomic.
        \item $D_0$ is the ionization energy from the bottom state ($D_e\neq D_0$, but relations can be obtained via spectroscopy).
        \item It follows that
        \begin{equation*}
            q_\text{elec} = g_1\e[-(-D_e/k_BT)]+g_2\e[-E_2/k_BT]
        \end{equation*}
        \item If $\dd{T}\ll(E_2+D_e)$, then $q_\text{elec}=g_1\e[D_e/k_BT]$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Vibrational partition function.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item As before with the law of Dulong and Petit.
        \item It's a special point where $T=h\nu/k_B$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Rotational partition function.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Almost always classical.
        \item The rotational energy of a polyatomic molecule will almost always be $\frac{3}{2}k_B$.
        \item Let's look at a heteronuclear diatomic, such as \ce{CO}. Derives
        \begin{equation*}
            q_\text{rot} = \sum_{J=0}^\infty(2J+1)\e[-\hbar^2J(J+1)/2Ik_BT]
        \end{equation*}
        \item The \textbf{rotational temperature} leads to
        \begin{equation*}
            q_\text{rot} = \sum_{J=0}^\infty(2J+1)\e[\Theta_\text{rot}/T] = \frac{T}{\Theta_\text{rot}}
        \end{equation*}
        \item Thus, at the temperature at which we exist, rotation is equivalent classically to quantum mechanically.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Rotational temperature}: The following quantity. \emph{Denoted by} $\bm{\Theta_\textbf{rot}}$. \emph{Given by}
    \begin{equation*}
        \Theta_\text{rot} = \hbar^2/2Ik_B
    \end{equation*}
    \item PGS will not specify whether we need a quantum vs. classical model.
    \item Homonuclear diatomic (e.g., \ce{H2}).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The vibrational differences in energy become visible with spectroscopy.
    \end{itemize}
    \item $q_\text{rot}=T/2\Theta_\text{rot}$.
    \item Partition functions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If the molecule is linear, it's of the form $T/\Theta_\text{rot}$.
        \item If the molecule is nonlinear, it's of the form $T/2\Theta_\text{rot}$.
        \item Spherical top (e.g., \ce{CH4}):
        \begin{equation*}
            \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{\sigma}\left( \frac{T}{\Theta_\text{rot}} \right)^{3/2}
        \end{equation*}
        \item Symmetric top (e.g., \ce{NH3}):
        \begin{equation*}
            \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{\sigma}\sqrt{\frac{T^3}{\Theta_{\text{rot},a}^2\Theta_{\text{rot},b}}}
        \end{equation*}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $a$ and $b$ are the two different symmetry axes.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Asymmetric top (e.g., \ce{H2O}):
        \begin{equation*}
            \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{\sigma}\sqrt{\frac{T^3}{\Theta_{\text{rot},a}\Theta_{\text{rot},b}\Theta_{\text{rot},c}}}
        \end{equation*}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Application to total energy and heat capacity of a molecule.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We have that
        \begin{equation*}
            q = \left( \frac{2\pi mk_BT}{h^2} \right)^{3/2}\cdot V\cdot\sqrt{\frac{T^2}{\sigma\Theta_{\text{rot},a}\Theta_{\text{rot},b}\Theta_{\text{rot},c}}}\cdot\sum_1^{3N-6}\frac{\e[-\Theta_\text{vib}/2T]}{1-\e[\Theta_\text{vib}/T]}\cdot g_1\e[D_e/k_BT]
        \end{equation*}
        \item Thus,
        \begin{equation*}
            \prb{E} = k_BT^2\pdv{\ln q}{T}
            = k_BT^2\pdv{T}(\frac{3}{2}\ln T+\text{constant}+\frac{3}{2}\ln T+\text{vibration}-D_e)
        \end{equation*}
        \item The energy of the vibration is $E=k_B\Theta_\text{vib}/(\e[\Theta_\text{vib}/k_BT]-1)+k_B\Theta_\text{vib}/2$. It follows that
        \begin{equation*}
            C = \pdv{E}{T}
            = k_B\frac{\Theta_\text{vib}^2}{T^2}\frac{\e[-\Theta_\text{vib}/T]}{(1-\e[-\Theta_\text{vib}/T])}
        \end{equation*}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}



\section{Chapter 18: Partition Functions and Ideal Gases}
\emph{From \textcite{bib:McQuarrieSimon}.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \marginnote{1/23:}Herein, we will calculate the partition functions and heat capacities of ideal gases.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We heavily rely on the expression of the partition function for a system of independent, indistinguishable particles, which ideal gases are likely to satisfy because of their low density.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Deriving the translational molecular partition function of an atom in a monatomic ideal gas.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item As mentioned in Chapter 17, if we let the container be cubic, then
        \begin{equation*}
            \varepsilon(n_x,n_y,n_z) = \frac{h^2}{8ma^2}(n_x^2+n_y^2+n_z^2)
        \end{equation*}
        \item It follows that
        \begin{align*}
            q_\text{trans} &= \sum_{n_x,n_y,n_z=1}^\infty\e[-\beta\varepsilon(n_x,n_y,n_z)]\\
            &= \sum_{n_x=1}^\infty\exp(-\frac{\beta h^2n_x^2}{8ma^2})\sum_{n_y=1}^\infty\exp(-\frac{\beta h^2n_y^2}{8ma^2})\sum_{n_z=1}^\infty\exp(-\frac{\beta h^2n_z^2}{8ma^2})\\
            &= \left[ \sum_{n=1}^\infty\exp(-\frac{\beta h^2n^2}{8ma^2}) \right]^3
        \end{align*}
        \item The above sum cannot be evaluated in closed form. However, since later terms in the summation get very small, it is an excellent approximation to replace the summation with an integral, i.e.,
        \begin{align*}
            q_\text{trans} &= \left( \int_0^\infty\e[-\beta h^2n^2/8ma^2]\dd{n} \right)^3\\
            &= \left( \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{4\beta h^2/8ma^2}} \right)^3\\
            &= \left( \sqrt{\frac{2\pi m}{\beta h^2}} \right)^3a^3\\
            &= \left( \frac{2\pi mk_BT}{h^2} \right)^{3/2}V
        \end{align*}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \marginnote{1/24:}Deriving the electronic molecular partition function of an atom in a monatomic ideal gas.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We express the partition function here in terms of levels, i.e., by
        \begin{equation*}
            q_\text{elec} = \sum_ig_{ei}\e[-\beta\varepsilon_{ei}]
        \end{equation*}
        where $g_{ei}$ is the degeneracy and $\varepsilon_{ei}$ is the energy of the $i^\text{th}$ electronic level.
        \item Taking $\varepsilon_{e1}=0$ to be the zero of energy yields
        \begin{equation*}
            q_\text{elec} = g_{e1}+g_{e2}\e[-\beta\varepsilon_{e2}]+\cdots
        \end{equation*}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Note that since $\varepsilon$'s are usually on the order of tens of thousands of wavenumbers, $\e[-\beta\varepsilon_{e2}]$ is around $10^{-5}$ for most atoms at ordinary temperatures, so only the first term in the summation is significantly different from zero.
            \item For some gases such as halogens, other terms may be important, but even there the sum converges very rapidly.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Using spectroscopic data, we can show that the fraction of atoms of most gases in the first excited state is very small.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item For example, the fraction of helium atoms at $\SI{300}{\kelvin}$ in the first excited state is $10^{-334}$.
            \item For fluorine, however, the fraction is on the order of $10^{-2}$, which is significant. In this case, we need to approximate $q_\text{elec}$ with more than one or two terms.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textcite{bib:McQuarrieSimon} recalculates the average energy, heat capacity, and pressure of a monatomic ideal gas using the above results.
    \item Diatomics.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The translational partition function is
        \begin{equation*}
            q_\text{trans}(V,T) = \left[ \frac{2\pi(m_1+m_2)k_BT}{h^2} \right]^{3/2}V
        \end{equation*}
        \item We take the zero of rotational energy to be the $J=0$ state.
        \item We take the zero of vibrational energy to be the bottom of the internuclear potential well of the lowest electronic state (so that the energy of the ground vibrational state is $h\nu/2$).
        \item We take the zero of electronic energy to be the energy of the separated atoms at rest in their ground electronic state (so that the energy of the ground electronic state is $-D_e$\footnote{See Figure 9.7 of \textcite{bib:CHEM26100Notes}.}).
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Vibrational temperature}: The following quantity. \emph{Denoted by} $\bm{\Theta_\text{vib}}$. \emph{Given by}
    \begin{equation*}
        \Theta_\text{vib} = \frac{h\nu}{k_B}
    \end{equation*}
    \item Deriving the vibrational molecular partition function of a molecule in a diatomic ideal gas.
    \begin{align*}
        q_\text{vib}(T) &= \sum_{v=0}^\infty\e[-\beta(v+1/2)h\nu]\\
        &= \e[-\beta h\nu/2]\sum_{v=0}^\infty\e[-\beta h\nu v]\\
        &= \e[-\beta h\nu/2]\frac{1}{1-\e[-\beta h\nu]}\\
        &= \frac{\e[-\beta h\nu/2]}{1-\e[-\beta h\nu]}
    \end{align*}
    \item In terms of $\Theta_\text{vib}$,
    \begin{gather*}
        q_\text{vib}(T) = \frac{\e[-\Theta_\text{vib}/2T]}{1-\e[-\Theta_\text{vib}/T]}\\
        \prb{E_\text{vib}} = Nk_B\left( \frac{\Theta_\text{vib}}{2}+\frac{\Theta_\text{vib}}{\e[\Theta_\text{vib}/T]-1} \right)\\
        \overline{C}_\text{V,\text{vib}} = R\left( \frac{\Theta_\text{vib}}{T} \right)^2\frac{\e[-\Theta_\text{vib}/T]}{(1-\e[-\Theta_\text{vib}/T])^2}
    \end{gather*}
    \item Note that the high temperature limit of $\overline{C}_\text{V,\text{vib}}$ is $R$, and $\overline{C}_\text{V,\text{vib}}$ attains $R/2$ at $T=0.34\,\Theta_\text{vib}$.
    \item Calculating the fraction of molecules in the ground vibrational state reveals that generally, most molecules are in the ground vibrational state.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Exceptions include \ce{Br2}, the smaller force constant and larger mass of which lead to a smaller value of $\Theta_\text{vib}$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Rotational temperature}: The following quantity. \emph{Denoted by} $\bm{\Theta_\text{rot}}$. \emph{Given by}
    \begin{equation*}
        \Theta_\text{rot} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2Ik_B} = \frac{hB}{k_B}
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $B$ is the rotational constant (see Chapter 5) in the above equation.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Deriving the rotational molecular partition function of a molecule in a diatomic ideal gas.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We have
        \begin{equation*}
            q_\text{rot}(T) = \sum_{J=0}^\infty(2J+1)\e[-\Theta_\text{rot}J(J+1)/T]
        \end{equation*}
        \item As with the translational partition function, for $\Theta_\text{rot}\ll T$ (which is true for normal temperatures), we may approximate the above sum via an integral. This approximation is known as the high-temperature limit, and under it,
        \begin{align*}
            q_\text{rot}(T) &= \int_0^\infty(2J+1)\e[-\Theta_\text{rot}J(J+1)/T]\dd{J}\\
            &= \int_0^\infty\e[-\Theta_\text{rot}x/T]\dd{x}\\
            &= \frac{T}{\Theta_\text{rot}} = \frac{8\pi^2Ik_BT}{h^2}
        \end{align*}
        \item For low temperatures or molecules with large values of $\Theta_\text{rot}$ we evaluate some number of terms of the sum directly, but we will not consider these cases further.
    \end{itemize}
    \item It follows from the above that
    \begin{align*}
        \prb{E_\text{rot}} &= Nk_BT&
        \overline{C}_{V,\text{rot}} &= R
    \end{align*}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Each of the two rotational degrees of freedom of a diatomic contributes $R/2$ to $\overline{C}_{V,\text{rot}}$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Contrary to the other component parts of energy, higher energy rotational states are significantly occupied.

    \end{figure}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We have that the fraction $f_J$ of molecules in the $J^\text{th}$ vibrational state is
        \begin{equation*}
            f_J = \frac{(2J+1)\e[-\Theta_\text{rot}J(J+1)/T]}{q_\text{rot}} = (2J+1)(\tfrac{\Theta_\text{rot}}{T})\e[-\Theta_\text{rot}J(J+1)/T]
        \end{equation*}
        \item We can estimate the most probable value of $J$ by solving $\pdv*{f_J}{J}=0$, which gives $J=7$ in agreement with Figure \ref{fig:rotationalPopulations}.
    \end{itemize}
