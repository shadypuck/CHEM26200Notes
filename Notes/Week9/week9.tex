\chapter{Solid-Liquid Solutions and Electrochemistry}
\section{Solute Activity}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \marginnote{3/7:}At low concentration, solute activity is unity, with the chosen measure of concentration.
    \item Activity of ions in electrolytes initially decreases rapidly with concentration below \SI{1}{\molar}. The effect is much stronger than for neutral solutes.
    \item The Debye-H\"{u}ckel model reasonably explains why ion activity drops so quickly.
    \item Practical solution concentration measures are the \textbf{molarity} and \textbf{molality}, in addition to the mole fraction $x$.
    \item \textbf{Molality}: The number of moles of solute per kilogram solvent. \emph{Denoted by} $\bm{m}$. \emph{Given by}
    \begin{equation*}
        m = \frac{n_2}{\SI{1}{\kilo\gram\ solvent}}
    \end{equation*}
    \item \textbf{Concentration}: The number of moles of solute per liter solution. \emph{Also known as} \textbf{molarity}. \emph{Denoted by} $\bm{c}$. \emph{Given by}
    \begin{equation*}
        c = \frac{n_2}{\SI{1}{\liter\ solution}}
    \end{equation*}
    \item As the solvent gets purer, its vapor pressure approaches the Raoult's law limit.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $a_1=P_1/P_1^*\to x_1$ as $x_1\to 1$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item As the solute's concentration diminishes, the solute activity approaches the Henry's law limit.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $a_2=P_2/k_H\to x_2$ as $x_2\to 0$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Using the vapor pressure of the solvent to determine the activity of the non-volatile solute.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use the Gibbs-Duhem relation,
        \begin{align*}
            0 &= n_1\dd{\ln a_1}+n_2\dd{\ln a_2}\\
            &= (\SI{55.506}{\mole\per\kilo\gram})\dd{\ln a_1}+m\dd{\ln a_2}\\
            \ln a_2 &= \int_0^m-\frac{55.506}{m'}\dd{(\ln a_1)}\dd{m'}
        \end{align*}
        \item But $\dd{(\ln a_1)}$ may not be very precise; thus, we define the \textbf{osmotic coefficient}.
        \item With this quantity, we have
        \begin{equation*}
            \dd{\ln a_1} = -\dd{(m\phi)}\cdot\frac{1}{55.506}
        \end{equation*}
        \item Thus, we have that
        \begin{align*}
            0 &= -\dd{(m\phi)}+m\dd{\ln a_2}\\
            \phi\dd{m}+m\dd{\phi} &= m\dd{\ln\gamma_2}+\dd{m}\\
            \frac{\dd{m}}{m}\phi+\dd{\phi} &= \dd{\ln\gamma_2}+\frac{\dd{m}}{m}\\
            \dd{\ln\gamma_2} &= \dd{\phi}+\left( \frac{\phi-1}{m} \right)\dd{m}\\
            \ln\gamma_2 &= (\phi-1)+\int_0^m\frac{\phi-1}{m'}\dd{m'}
        \end{align*}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Osmotic coefficient}: The following quantity. \emph{Denoted by} $\bm{\phi}$. \emph{Given by}
    \begin{equation*}
        \phi = -\frac{\ln a_1}{x_2}
        = -\ln a_1\cdot\frac{\SI{55.506}{\mole\per\kilo\gram}}{m}
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It is called the osmotic coefficient since $\Pi\overline{V}=-RT\ln a_1$ implies that as $x_2\to 0$, $\ln a_1\to -x_2$, so $\phi\to 1$.
        \item Even in the case of an ideal solution, $\phi\neq 1$ exactly, though, since we must mathematically \emph{approximate} $\ln a_1\approx -x_2$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Ionic solutions deviate strongly from ideal solution, even at small molality.
    \item Mean ionic activity, molality, and activity coefficient.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The salt $\ce{C}_{\nu_+}\ce{A}_{\nu_-}$ dissociates into $\nu_+$ \ce{C^{$z_+$}} ions and $\nu_-$ \ce{A^{$z_-$}} ions where
        \begin{equation*}
            \nu_+z_++\nu_-z_- = 0
        \end{equation*}
        for charge neutrality.
        \item Let $\nu=\nu_++\nu_-$.
        \item The chemical potential of the salt is
        \begin{align*}
            \mu_\text{salt} &= \nu_+\mu_++\nu_-\mu_-\\
            &= \nu_+\mu_+^\circ+\nu_-\mu_-^\circ+RT(\nu_+\ln a_++\nu_-\ln a_-)+RT\ln\big( \underbrace{a_+^{\nu_+}a_-^{\nu_-}}_{a_2} \big)
        \end{align*}
        \item Hence,
        \begin{align*}
            a_2 &= a_+^{\nu_+}a_-^{\nu_-}\\
            &= (\gamma_+^{\nu_+}\gamma_-^{\nu_-})(m_+^{\nu_+}m_-^{\nu_-})\\
            &= a_\pm^\nu\\
            &= \gamma_\pm^\nu m_\pm^\nu
        \end{align*}
        where $a_\pm$ is the \textbf{mean activity}, $\gamma_\pm$ is the \textbf{mean activity coefficient}, and $m_\pm$ is the \textbf{mean molality}.
        \item It follows that
        \begin{align*}
            \mu_2 &= \mu_2^\circ+RT\ln a_\pm^\nu\\
            &= \mu_2^\circ+\nu RT\ln a_\pm
        \end{align*}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Consider a solution of \ce{CaCl2} with molality $m$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It has
        \begin{align*}
            m_+ &= m&
            m_- &= 2m
        \end{align*}
        \item Thus,
        \begin{align*}
            m_\pm &= \sqrt{m_+^1m_-^2}\\
            &= \sqrt{4m^3}\\
            &= 4^{1/3}m
        \end{align*}
        \item We can do something similar for $\gamma_\pm$ and $a_\pm$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Determining the activity of electrolytes.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The derivation is pretty similar to before (for nonvolatile solvents), except that now $\ln a_1=-\nu m\phi/55.506$.
        \item It follows that
        \begin{align*}
            0 &= n_1\dd{\ln a_1}+n_2\dd{\ln a_2}\\
            &= -\nu\dd{(m\phi)}+m\nu\dd{\ln a_\pm}
        \end{align*}
        so $\nu$ cancels.
        \item This yields the same overall equation as before:
        \begin{equation*}
            \ln\gamma_\pm = (\phi-1)+\int_0^m\frac{\phi-1}{m'}\dd{m'}
        \end{equation*}
    \end{itemize}
    \item We can do the above, but ion activity can also be measured by electrochemistry.
\end{itemize}



\section{Chapter 25: Solutions II --- Solid-Liquid Solutions}
\emph{From \textcite{bib:McQuarrieSimon}.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \marginnote{3/8:}Oppositely charged ions in solution interact with each other via a Coulombic potential, which varies proportionally to $1/r$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Note the difference between the strength of this potential and the LDF potential of $1/r^6$ attracting ordinary neutral molecules.
        \item It follows that solutions of electrolytes deviate from ideality much more quickly (i.e., at much lower concentrations).
    \end{itemize}
    \item When ions with higher charges (e.g., \ce{CaCl2} vs. \ce{NaCl}) are produced, the deviation from ideality is exacerbated.
    \item \textbf{$\bm{a}$-$\bm{b}$ electrolyte}: An electrolyte for which $\nu_+=a$ and $\nu_-=b$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For example, \ce{CaCl2} is a 1-2 electrolyte and \ce{Gd2(SO4)3} is a 2-3 electrolyte.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The chemical potential of a salt depends on the potentials of its constituent ions as per
    \begin{equation*}
        \mu_2 = \nu_+\mu_++\nu_-\mu_-
    \end{equation*}
    where $\mu_j=\mu_j^\circ+RT\ln a_j$ for $j=2,+,-$.
    \item It follows from the above and the fact that $\mu_2^\circ=\nu_+\mu_+^\circ+\nu_-\mu_-^\circ$, too, that
    \begin{align*}
        \mu_2^\circ+RT\ln a_2 &= \nu_+(\mu_+^\circ+RT\ln a_+)+\nu_-(\mu_-^\circ+RT\ln a_-)\\
        RT\ln a_2 &= \nu_+RT\ln a_++\nu_-RT\ln a_-\\
        \ln a_2 &= \nu_+\ln a_++\nu_-\ln a_-\\
        a_2 &= a_+^{\nu_+}a_-^{\nu_-}
    \end{align*}
    \item We define $\nu=\nu_++\nu_-$.
    \item \textbf{Mean ionic activity}: The following quantity. \emph{Denoted by} $a_\pm$. \emph{Given by}
    \begin{equation*}
        a_\pm^\nu = a_+^{\nu_+}a_-^{\nu_-}
    \end{equation*}
    \item We take the activity $a_2$ of an electrolyte to be its mean ionic activity to the $\nu^\text{th}$ power, i.e., $a_2=a_\pm^\nu$.
    \item We cannot determine the activities of single ions.
    \item We define the molalities of individual ions by
    \begin{align*}
        m_+ &= \nu_+m&
        m_- &= \nu_-m
    \end{align*}
    \item We define single-ion activity coefficients by
    \begin{align*}
        \gamma_+ &= \frac{a_+}{m_+}&
        \gamma_- &= \frac{a_-}{m_-}
    \end{align*}
    \item \textbf{Mean ionic molarity}: The following quantity. \emph{Denoted by} $m_\pm$. \emph{Given by}
    \begin{equation*}
        m_\pm^\nu = m_+^{\nu_+}m_-^{\nu_-}
    \end{equation*}
    \item \textbf{Mean ionic activity coefficient}: The following quantity. \emph{Denoted by} $\gamma_\pm$. \emph{Given by}
    \begin{equation*}
        \gamma_\pm^\nu = \gamma_+^{\nu_+}\gamma_-^{\nu_-}
    \end{equation*}
    \item It follows that
    \begin{equation*}
        a_2 = a_\pm^\nu
        = (m_+^{\nu_+}m_-^{\nu_-})(\gamma_+^{\nu_+}\gamma_-^{\nu_-})
        = m_\pm^\nu\gamma_\pm^\nu
    \end{equation*}
    \item \textcite{bib:McQuarrieSimon} derives
    \begin{equation*}
        \ln\gamma_\pm = (\phi-1)+\int_0^m\frac{\phi-1}{m'}\dd{m'}
    \end{equation*}
    \item For colligative properties, since $x_2$ is scaled up by a factor of $\nu$, we get
    \begin{align*}
        \Delta T_\text{fus} &= \nu K_fm&
        \Delta T_\text{vap} &= \nu K_bm&
        \Pi &= \nu cRT
    \end{align*}
    for solutions of electrolytes.
    \item Debye and H\"{u}ckel showed theoretically in 1925 that at low concentrations, the natural logarithms of the $j^\text{th}$ ion's activity coefficient and the mean ionic activity coefficient are given by
    \begin{align*}
        \ln\gamma_j &= -\frac{\kappa q_j^2}{8\pi\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_rk_BT}&
        \ln\gamma_\pm &= -|q_+q_-|\frac{\kappa}{8\pi\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_rk_BT}
    \end{align*}
    where $q_+=z_+e$ and $q_-=z_-e$, $\varepsilon_r$ is the (unitless) relative permittivity of the solvent, and $\kappa$ is given by
    \begin{equation*}
        \kappa^2 = \sum_{j=1}^s\frac{q_j^2}{\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_rk_BT}\left( \frac{N_j}{V} \right)
    \end{equation*}
    $s$ being the number of ionic species and $N_j/V$ being the number density of species $j$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Converting $N_j/V$ to molarity allows us to rewrite the above as
        \begin{equation*}
            \kappa^2 = N_A(\SI{1000}{\liter\per\cubic\meter})\sum_{j=1}^s\frac{q_j^2c_j}{\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_rk_BT}
        \end{equation*}
        \item This result is derived in Problems 25-50 through 25-58.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Debye-H\"{u}ckel limiting law}: The above expression for $\ln\gamma_\pm$.
    \item \textbf{Ionic strength}: The following quantity. \emph{Denoted by} $\bm{I_c}$. \emph{Given by}
    \begin{equation*}
        I_c = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{j=1}^sz_j^2c_j
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $c_j$ is the molarity of the $j^\text{th}$ ionic species.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Having defined the ionic strength, we can write express $\kappa$ in a third form as
    \begin{equation*}
        \kappa^2 = \frac{2e^2N_A(\SI{1000}{\liter\per\cubic\meter})}{\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_rk_BT}(I_c/\si{\mole\per\liter})
    \end{equation*}
    \item In the Debye-H\"{u}ckel limiting law, $\ln\gamma_\pm\propto\kappa\propto\sqrt{I_c}\propto\sqrt{c}$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This is why we curve fit $\phi$ vs. $m$ data to a polynomial in $m^{1/2}$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item As $m\to 0$, all curves $\ln\gamma_\pm$ vs. $m$ converge to the same straight line (hence this being a \emph{limiting} law).
    \item Physically interpreting $\kappa$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The net charge in a spherical shell of radius $r$ and thickness $\dd{r}$ surrounding an ion of charge $q_i$ is given by
        \begin{equation*}
            p_i(r)\dd{r} = -q_i\kappa^2r\e[-\kappa r]\dd{r}
        \end{equation*}
        \item Integrating this equation over all space yields $-q_i$.
        \item Thus, "the total charge surrounding an ion of charge $q_i$ is equal and of the opposite sign to $q_i$. In other words, it expresses the electroneutrality of the solution" \parencite[1033-34]{bib:McQuarrieSimon}.
        \item The above equation describes the \textbf{ionic atmosphere} about the central ion.
        \item Additionally, its maximum occurs at $\kappa^{-1}$, so we say that $\kappa$ is a measure of the thickness of the ionic atmosphere.
    \end{itemize}
    \item For a 1-1 electrolyte in aqueous solution at \SI{25}{\celsius},
    \begin{equation*}
        \kappa = \frac{\SI{304}{\pico\meter}}{\sqrt{c/\si{\mole\per\liter}}}
    \end{equation*}
    \item Assumptions of the Debye-H\"{u}ckel theory:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Ions are point particles.
        \item They interact with a purely Coulombic potential.
        \item The solvent is a continuous medium with a uniform relative permittivity $\varepsilon_r$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Clearly, these will start to break down as their concentration increases.
    \item The Debye-H\"{u}ckel model has been of important utility mainly in that all models that attempt to treat higher concentrations must reduce to it at lower temperatures.
    \item Real progress toward a more general theory wasn't made until the 1970s, though.
    \item \textbf{Primitive model}: Ions are considered hard spheres with charges at their centers and the solvent is considered a continuous medium with a uniform relative permittivity.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Although, well, primitive, long-range Coulombic interactions and short-range repulsions, which this model encapsulates well, turn out to be major considerations, so the model is pretty good.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The mean spherical approximation (MSA) provides analytical solutions.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A central result is that
        \begin{equation*}
            \ln\gamma_\pm = \ln\gamma_\pm^\text{el}+\ln\gamma^\text{HS}
        \end{equation*}
        where $\ln\gamma_\pm^\text{el}$ is an electrostatic (Coulombic) contribution to $\ln\gamma_\pm$ and $\ln\gamma^\text{HS}$ is a hard-sphere contribution.
        \item For a 1-1 electrolyte,
        \begin{equation*}
            \ln\gamma_\pm^\text{el} = \frac{x\sqrt{1+2x}-x-x^2}{4\pi\rho d^3}
        \end{equation*}
        where $\rho$ is the number density of charged particles, $d$ is the sum of the radius of a cation and anion, and $x=\kappa d$. Also,
        \begin{equation*}
            \ln\gamma^\text{HS} = \frac{4y-\frac{9}{4}y^2+\frac{3}{8}y^3}{\left( 1-\frac{y}{2} \right)^3}
        \end{equation*}
        where $y=\pi\rho d^3/6$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
